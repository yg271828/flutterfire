##  What does it do?

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.

Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification
messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer
a payload of up to 4KB to a client app.
