##  What does it do?

Google Analytics is a free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement. 
Analytics reports help you understand clearly how your users behave, which enables you to make informed decisions regarding app marketing and performance optimizations.

## Installation

### 1. Add dependency

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  firebase_analytics: "^{{ plugins.firebase_analytics }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. (Web Only) Add the SDK

If using FlutterFire on the web, add the `firebase-analytics` JavaScript SDK to your `index.html` file:

```html {5} title="web/index.html"
<html>
  ...
  <body>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-analytics.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
### 4. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Firebase Analytics in your Flutter Project.
